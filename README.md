### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently looking for a DevOps job in Canada Waterloo-Kitchener area or remote.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about DevOps and Observability.

Hello! I'm an SRE/DevOps Engineer with around 10 years of experience, where I've had the chance to work in diverse environments like startups, large companies, and government projects. My journey has been about more than just technology; I've also had the opportunity to lead teams and delve into cloud technologies such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and tools like Atlassian and GitLab.

I really value teamwork and find joy in solving complex challenges. My experience spans infrastructure, observability, and coding, and I'm always open to learning new things.

In my personal time, I enjoy working on coding projects, from creating Java-based interfaces for Arduino to exploring game development in Unity using C#.

Recently, I moved from New Zealand to Waterloo, Ontario due to family commitments, and am looking forward to joining a team where I can contribute, learn, and grow together. I'm excited about the possibilities and eager to see where this journey takes me.
